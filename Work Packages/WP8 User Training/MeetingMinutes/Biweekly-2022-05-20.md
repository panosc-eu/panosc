4. Compute infrastructure for summer school
  - ELI want to set up VISA but it might be complex (don't have open stack)
  - There has been good progress of setting up VISA at ESS, depends on how much stress the system will be under and which images and containers are needed
  - Where will the data be? - The data will be wherever it needs to be (using VISA the students could add data to the instance)
  - Try and make sure the data loads are not too high! (large datasets will need good prior planning)
  - Miguel will speak with the IT people at ILL to see about "special VISA" for the school
  - Details for resources from Science Days is needed to understand if VISA at ESS will be a viable option (as specific as possible)
5. AOB
  - Miguel met with the Hercules school organisers, they are happy for others to use the videos that are present on YouTube (i.e. for new courses on e-learning; but contact presenter) and they will consider using e-learning in future versions of Hercules
