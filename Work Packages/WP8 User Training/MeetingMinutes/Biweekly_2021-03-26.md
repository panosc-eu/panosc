### GitHub repository

After having created a WP8 repo in the GitHub panosc organization, 
we decided to create our own GitHub organization [pan-training](https://github.com/pan-training). 
Peter has cloned the [pan-learning-django-tools](https://github.com/pan-training/pan-learning-djangotools) 
repo to that organization and Thomas has created [two projects](https://github.com/orgs/pan-training/projects) 
for now; one for training portal and one for e-learning platform. The projects are located at the top level 
organization and not in a repository. 

Thomas has created a milestone for each task in PaNOSC WP8 and an associated issue for each deliverable and has 
generally started to populate the pan-learning.org project with issues, both technically ones and related to 
content creation. In some case people has also been assigned. 

Some issues are pretty large and may benefit from being converted to a GitHub milestone. 

- [ ] We neeed to ensure that everybody can contribute and also create issues, etc. 


### pan-learning.org clone for testing
ESS is creating a clone of pan-learning.org that can be used for testing. 

### Other technical updates


### ExPaNDS updates
ExPaNDS workshop on EOSC in preparation (06-07 April 2021).

### PaNOSC updates

* TtT workshop Part 2 took place this week. Markedly reduced participation. 
   - Impression is that participants were generally happy about the workshop, but when coming back to their home institutes it's hard to find time for this kind of stuff. 
   - Got some useful input for further developing pan-learning.org. 
   - Demo of Illumidesk/nbgrader Jupyter implementation
      - [ ] Submit final milestone report 
* NIST has shown interest in using pan-learning for training in SANS. 
* ESS runs weekly meetings focusing on using outcomes from WP5 in WP8.
