1. Training Portal
The Umbrella issues are not solved yet. The workshop was postponed with no new date set. Oliver tested Umbrella on Wednsday and it worked at HZDR. There are some settings that are not correct. The portal at ESS only works for people with DMSC specific accounts. There needs to be alignment between the Umbrella ID team and ESS.
