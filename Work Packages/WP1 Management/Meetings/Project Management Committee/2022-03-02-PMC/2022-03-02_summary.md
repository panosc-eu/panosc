**1. Periodic Report feedback**

Jordi reported the feedback obtained from the EC regarding the periodic report submitted in January. The minor feedback must be addressed and the report resubmitted within 15 days (i.e. no later than 15/03).
In particular, the feedback affects ESS (deviations) and EGI (financial info and deviations). Jordi also took the opportunity to announce that an Executive Board meeting is planned for 1st of April and that an invitation has been shared with the EB members. Jordi explained that not all members were available and the chosen date means that Jonathan (ESS) will not be available. Thomas replied that he will hold internal conversations at ESS to check who can best replace Jonathan.

**2. Presentation**
Ornela shared a presentation [link to the presentation in GitHub] to discuss the common vision on the future PaN EOSC and introduces the context, including a benchmarking with other science clusters. She explains that in order to ensure the sustainability of the PaN EOSC  we must show the value that the outcomes of PaNOSC produce to the different stakeholders (from users to the European Commission) and proposes to launch a draft questionnaire for users, to support the value proposition with data from the final users of the services.

It was discussed that stakeholders consultation on PaNOSC services through a survey could be carried out to identify which services should be sustained after the end of the project.
The survey could potentially gather feedback on the quality of the services than the sustainability.PaNOSC services could be sustained by local implementation at RIs with their own resources. However, the coordinator was not favourable to a general survey for users on the services and proposed to measure instead the use of the currently available services. Ornela explains that this information will not be available for all services, since some will be delivered towards the end of the project, so the results will not be representative. Regarding the future vision of the PaN EOSC, it remains open, there is no clear common vision emerging from the discussion amongst the partners.
