Work Package 1 – Management
=========================================================	
The management work package focuses on fostering communication between all the PaNOSC work packages, team members and stakeholders (including coordination with ExPaNDS), ensuring the governance rules are respected and controlling budget and timescales for completing deliverables and other internal products. 
The ESRF, as the leading partner in this work package, is in charge of these actions, with the project manager in particular being responsible for their successful implementation. 
One key aspect for successful project management is ensuring the project’s structure of accountability and responsibilities.

Work Package 2 – Data Policy and Stewardship
=========================================================	
Work Package 2 is about Data Policies and Data Management Plans. The goals are to: 
*	Produce guidelines on best practices based on existing Data Policies adopted by the Photon and Neutron RIs (ESFRI and national RIs),
*	Propose a new framework for Data Policies taking into account the FAIR principles
*	Adopt or align Data Policies at all PanOSC sites
*	Implement DMP templates for users applying for beam time at the PaNOSC sites.

[Download the PaNOSC FAIR research data policy framework](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3862701)

The approach followed has been to survey the existing Data Policies of the PaNOSC sites – ILL, ESRF, EuXFEL, CERIC-ERIC, ESS and Observers (PSI, ALBA, SOLEIL, Diamond Light Source), and compile a document including commonalities and differences.
FAIR principles have then been studied in depth with the help of organisations specialised in interpreting and applying FAIR principles and GDPR to scientific research data (GO-FAIR, FAIRsFAIR). A set of guidelines will be produced by all PaNOSC RIs (including Observers), taking into account the specific needs of the Photon and Neutron community. 
A new Data Policy framework will then be produced for adoption or adaption of existing Data Policies at the PaNOSC partners. 
Some of the features already identified to be included in the Data Policies are: 
*	A common understanding of GDPR-compliant scientific research data; 
*	How to address rich metadata including electronic logbooks in Data Policies; 
*	How to include processed and/or analysed data;
*	What licence to adopt for research data. 
Assistance will be provided to labs needing to adopt the Data Policy (ELI, CERIC-ERIC) in the form of presentations and visits between labs, to explain and discuss the need to adopt and implement a Data Policy.
A set of DMP templates for users producing data at the PaNOSC sites will be produced by ESS and implemented at all partner sites. The templates will be based on existing online services for DMPs with customisation for the PaNOSC users. CERIC-ERIC will follow up the implementation of Data Policies with surveys, metrics and interviews of implementers and users.  
WP2 will work closely with WP3 and WP6 and WP7 to ensure that data policies are compliant with the requirements of the federation of catalogues over multiple sites, and with the EOSC data policy, and that are sustainable.

Work Package 3 – Data Catalog Services
=========================================================	
In work package 3, the partners create means for users and third parties to find datasets from photon and neutron sources using domain specific search terms. 
Contact with service providers from EOSC-Hub (B2Find) have been made, and various options have been explored. Exposing catalogues to OpenAIRE and/or repositories of similar richness of metadata should be the first step.
To go beyond the generic search features of OpenAIRE, the partners have been having exchanges on their current local practises, activities and plans, to align on a common definition of standard metadata for the scientific domains at the partner facilities. This activity also informs the local integration of data catalogues with the data sources (e.g. experimental stations).  
In the task that aims to use definitions of the community-driven NeXus file format for searches, the partner institutes should first familiarise themselves with the format and its governance processes. For sustainability reasons, it is critical that the PANOSC partners seek buy-in of community. The plan is to initiate this in a multi-day workshop meeting with partners and observers, to showcase the current state of NeXus and see what requirements from partners may need to be addressed by new NeXus definitions.

Work Package 4 – Data Analysis Services
=========================================================	
Data analysis is the process of extracting meaning from recorded data, enabling the transition from measurements to insights and new science. To make raw data usable and re-usable for research, it is critical that data analysis services are provided together with the data.
Work Package 4 focuses on the creation and provision data analysis services locally at the partner sites, and eventually through the EOSC. The work package has significant interactions with and dependencies on other work packages.

Work Package 5 – Virtual Neutron and X-ray Laboratory (VINYL)
=========================================================	
Work package 5 has been developing the “Virtual Neutron and x-raY Laboratory” (ViNYL).
ViNYL will offer services for simulation and modelling of neutron and photon sources, beamlines and experimental instrument, as well as start-to-end simulations to describe entire experiments at photon and neutron facilities.
ViNYL will agglutinate in a PaNOSC-compatible e-infrastructure software packages based on developments made by the involved partners, such as OASYS, McSTAS and SIMEX.
Strategies for interoperability in a python-based environment and use standardized file formats have started. Software packages in use are under integration in the PaNdata software catalogue. 
The GitHub organization PaNOSC-ViNYL serves as the central hub for developments in WP5. It will collect forks of involved software projects and host the repositories for proper developments.
Milestones reached
•	All simulation codes and frameworks were added to the PaNdata software catalogue.
•	Domain specific extensions published, to the simulation metadata standard openPMD for coherent wavefront data, molecular dynamics, photon and neutron raytracing (https://github.com/PaNOSC-ViNYL/openPMD-standard).
•	The new simulation API libpyvinyl has started to be adopted in various simulation frameworks: SIMEX (start-to-end photon experiment simulations), McStas-Script (Neutron raytracing), OASYS (x-ray optics simulation framework).

Work Package 6 – EOSC integration
=========================================================	
Work Package 6 is to be conceived as a support activity for the other work packages. 
Specifically, it will prepare and ensure the integration of the PaNOSC services into EOSC by organising the services support, by preparing the Authentication and Authorisation Infrastructure, by exploring the data transfer to the compute facilities and by participating in the EOSC definition.

Work Package 7 – Sustainability
=========================================================	
This work package will explore the issues related to the sustainability of the services developed and made available through the EOSC.
The identification of and interaction with the relevant stakeholders will be fundamental to address the open questions about the EOSC business model.
The metrics for costs developed in close collaboration with the facilities at an advanced stage of implementation of open access services, will allow the partners to propose realistic business models, which will be described by using the business model canvas.
The WP will work in close collaboration with the other WPs to identify and address issues that may either contribute or threaten the sustainability of the EOSC in the long term. This communication is expected to happen both ways: other WPs will feed into WP7 the results from their experience as the implementation proceeds, while WP7 will contribute with guidelines for the sustainable implementation of tools and services.
Since the factors affecting the sustainability of the PaN EOSC are strongly related with those of other clusters, this WP will dedicate efforts to iterative interactions with the other EOSC clusters, as well as with the other stakeholders.
Before submission, all deliverables foresee the production of a draft document to be discussed and refined according to the feedback of stakeholders and PaNOSC partners.

Work Package 8 – Staff and User Training
=========================================================	
Work package 8 focuses on providing user and staff training in the realm of PaNOSC.
The Gantt chart below shows the schedule for activities, deliverables, and milestones in WP8.
 
The technical platform for WP8 is Pan-learning.org, which has been adapted from e-neutrons.org (developed in the EU projects NMI3 and SINE2020 specifically for neutron scattering). As part of PaNOSC, the platform – which will provide training resources for both staff and users of PaN sources – has been migrated to ESS and will be tailored to the needs of PaNOSC partners, i.e. the content will be expanded to cater for both the photon and neutron scattering communities and training related to outcomes of PaNOSC including data stewardship and data analysis.
The platform has so far been developed by staff at the European Spallation Source (ESS), Technical University of Denmark and University of Copenhagen, which will also support the migration and further development of teaching materials. ELI is also involved in the design team and integration of Jupyter technology.
A programme of workshops for training staff at the PaN facilities will be implemented starting 2021 in the field of data stewardship, to transfer the know-how on the use of the e-learning platform and develop new courses.
WP8 will also integrate Jupyter technology from WP4 into the e-learning platform to enable development of tutorials.
In addition, WP8 intends to leverage the developments in WP5 to enable the use of instrument simulations for teaching purposes.
